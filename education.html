    <p><h1>Using technology in a good way is very important. Being honest, respectful, and careful online shows responsibility. It teaches people to avoid lying, bullying, or copying others’ work.
We can use technology to share knowledge, help others, and make learning fun. Learning digital responsibility helps us grow as honest and thoughtful people.
I hope that by sharing these lessons, more people will act responsibly online and make the internet a safer and kinder place..</p></h1>
