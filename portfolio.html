    <p><h1> I believe that putting God first—“Una ang Ginoo”—helps me make the right choices every day. This idea guides how I live, learn, and use technology. Through this portfolio, I want to show how faith and technology can work together to inspire and help others. 
Each project reflects my effort to be honest, responsible, and kind online and offline, whether it is helping the community, creating educational content, or sharing good ideas.
Being creative, responsible, and honest is important to me. By sharing my work, I celebrate my growth and hope to encourage others to use their talents in ways that help people and honor God.
This portfolio is not just a collection of my work. It shows my goal to be the “Light of the World.”
