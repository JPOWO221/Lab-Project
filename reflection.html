    <p><h1>I believe that putting God first—“Una ang Ginoo”—helps me make good choices every day. It guides how I treat others, how I learn, and how I act online. I try to live with honesty, kindness, and faith in everything I do.
Thinking about my actions helps me grow as a person. I try to improve myself every day by learning from my mistakes and doing what is right.
By sharing my reflections, I hope to inspire others to put God first in their lives, make good choices, and treat others with respect and care..</p></h1>
